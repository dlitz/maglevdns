MaglevDNS to-do list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Look at replacing MaglevDNS::DNS with Net::DNS
- Add logging, since there currently is none.
- There are still a few places where there should be timeouts.  Add them.
- Fix FIXMEs, and generally make the code less ugly.
- Support for other things besides forwarding.
